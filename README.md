# big-two
The card game Big 2 made with Visual Studio and SFML in C++

The game is very playable, but not 100% finished. There are many variations and rules in Big 2, and this game just implements some of them. AI is very basic so it is not much of a challenge to play. 

Controls:
Click on cards to select them and press space or click PLAY to play the currently selected cards. Press escape or click PASS to pass for the rest of the round. 
Wait a few seconds or click on the screen for the AI to do their turns.
